## Bug Fixes

## Major Code Re-factoring

* The classes dealing with serializing or de-serializing public and private keys have been de-generified, which simplifies them a lot. Previous code from version 2 tried to tie particular public key types and private key types together via generics, such that it could be statically checked that only matching key types were used. But that never worked well and in a few crucial places unchecked conversions or raw types were used anyway, which makes the point moot. Code now just uses `PublicKey` and `PrivateKey` instead of generic types, and checks at run-time that keys are of the expected kind.
* The way ed25519 keys are handled has been refactored. Duplicate code has been removed, and the handling has been simplified to make it easier in the near future to include support for other eddsa implementations. This brings additional API breaks, but in code areas that are unlikely to be used in customer code.
