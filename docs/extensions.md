# Extension modules

There are several extension modules available - specifically, the _sshd-contrib_ module contains some of them. **Note:** the
module contains experimental code that may find its way some time in the future to a standard artifact. It is also subject to
changes and/or deletion without any prior announcement. Therefore, any code that relies on it should also store a copy of the
sources in case the classes it used it are modified or deleted.

## LDAP adaptors

The _sshd-ldap_ artifact contains an [LdapPasswordAuthenticator](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-607) and
an [LdapPublicKeyAuthenticator](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-608) that have been written along the same
lines as the [openssh-ldap-publickey](https://github.com/AndriiGrytsenko/openssh-ldap-publickey) project. The authenticators
can be easily configured to match most LDAP schemes, or alternatively serve as base classes for code that extends them
and adds proprietary logic.

## Useful extra components in _sshd-contrib_

* `InteractivePasswordIdentityProvider` - helps implement a `PasswordIdentityProvider` by delegating calls
to `UserInteraction#getUpdatedPassword`. The way to use it would be as follows:

```java
try (ClientSession session = client.connect(login, host, port).await().getSession()) {
     session.setUserInteraction(...);     // this can also be set at the client level
     PasswordIdentityProvider passwordIdentityProvider =
          InteractivePasswordIdentityProvider.providerOf(session, "My prompt");
     session.setPasswordIdentityProvider(passwordIdentityProvider);
     session.auth.verify(...timeout...);
     ... continue with the authenticated session ...
}
```

or

```java
UserInteraction ui = ....;
try (ClientSession session = client.connect(login, host, port).await().getSession()) {
    PasswordIdentityProvider passwordIdentityProvider =
         InteractivePasswordIdentityProvider.providerOf(session, ui, "My prompt");
    session.setPasswordIdentityProvider(passwordIdentityProvider);
    session.auth.verify(...timeout...);
     ... continue with the authenticated session ...
}
```

**Note:** `UserInteraction#isInteractionAllowed` is consulted prior to invoking `getUpdatedPassword` - if it
returns _false_ then password retrieval method is not invoked, and it is assumed that no more passwords are available

* `SimpleAccessControlScpEventListener` - Provides a simple access control by making a distinction between
methods that upload data and ones that download it via SCP. In order to use it, simply extend it and override
its `isFileUpload/DownloadAllowed` methods

* `SimpleAccessControlSftpEventListener` - Provides a simple access control by making a distinction between
methods that provide SFTP file information - including reading data - and those that modify it

* `ProxyProtocolAcceptor` - A working prototype to support the PROXY protocol as described in
[HAProxy Documentation](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt)

* `ThrottlingPacketWriter` - An example of a way to overcome big window sizes when sending data - as
described in [SSHD-754](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-754) and [SSHD-768](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-768)

* `AndroidOpenSSLSecurityProviderRegistrar` - A security registrar that uses the [AndroidOpenSSL](https://github.com/guardianproject/openssl-android)
security provider

* `LegacyDSASigner` - A `java.security.Signature` that applies SHA-1 with DSA keys regardless of their
key length - i.e., despite FIPS186-3 section 4.2 that mandates usage of SHA-2 for keys greater than
1024 bits. This is in accordance with RFC 4253 that was never amended to specify any other digest for
such keys. The signer can be use to provide a custom implementation of `SignatureDSA` (and its factory)
that uses this signer instead of the JCE or _Bouncycastle_ one - see comments on issue [SSHD-945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-945).
