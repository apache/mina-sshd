/**
 * Class for scanning a directory for files/directories which match certain
 * criteria.
 * <p/>
 * These criteria consist of selectors and patterns which have been specified.
 * With the selectors you can select which files you want to have included.
 * Files which are not selected are excluded. With patterns you can include
 * or exclude files based on their filename.
 * <p/>
 * The idea is simple. A given directory is recursively scanned for all files
 * and directories. Each file/directory is matched against a set of selectors,
 * including special support for matching against filenames with include and
 * and exclude patterns. Only files/directories which match at least one
 * pattern of the include pattern list or other file selector, and don't match
 * any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required
 * selector will be placed in the list of files/directories found.
 * <p/>
 * When no list of include patterns is supplied, "**" will be used, which
 * means that everything will be matched. When no list of exclude patterns is
 * supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded. When
 * no selectors are supplied, none are applied.
 * <p/>
 * The filename pattern matching is done as follows:
 * The name to be matched is split up in path segments. A path segment is the
 * name of a directory or file, which is bounded by
 * <code>File.separator</code> ('/' under UNIX, '\' under Windows).
 * For example, "abc/def/ghi/xyz.java" is split up in the segments "abc",
 * "def","ghi" and "xyz.java".
 * The same is done for the pattern against which should be matched.
 * <p/>
 * The segments of the name and the pattern are then matched against each
 * other. When '**' is used for a path segment in the pattern, it matches
 * zero or more path segments of the name.
 * <p/>
 * There is a special case regarding the use of <code>File.separator</code>s
 * at the beginning of the pattern and the string to match:<br>
 * When a pattern starts with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string
 * to match must also start with a <code>File.separator</code>.
 * When a pattern does not start with a <code>File.separator</code>, the
 * string to match may not start with a <code>File.separator</code>.
 * When one of these rules is not obeyed, the string will not
 * match.
 * <p/>
 * When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the
 * following special characters can be used:<br>
 * '*' matches zero or more characters<br>
 * '?' matches one character.
 * <p/>
 * Examples:
 * <p/>
 * "**\*.class" matches all .class files/dirs in a directory tree.
 * <p/>
 * "test\a??.java" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two
 * more characters and then ".java", in a directory called test.
 * <p/>
 * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
 * <p/>
 * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs which start with "XYZ" and where
 * there is a parent directory called test (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").
 * <p/>
 * Case sensitivity may be turned off if necessary. By default, it is
 * turned on.
 * <p/>
 * Example of usage:
 * <pre>
 *   String[] includes = {"**\\*.class"};
 *   String[] excludes = {"modules\\*\\**"};
 *   ds.setIncludes(includes);
 *   ds.setExcludes(excludes);
 *   ds.setBasedir(new File("test"));
 *   ds.setCaseSensitive(true);
 *   ds.scan();
 * <p/>
 *   System.out.println("FILES:");
 *   String[] files = ds.getIncludedFiles();
 *   for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
 *     System.out.println(files[i]);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * This will scan a directory called test for .class files, but excludes all
 * files in all proper subdirectories of a directory called "modules"
